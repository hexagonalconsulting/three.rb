# Three.rb

[Three.js](http://threejs.org) for Ruby via Opal.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'three.rb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install three.rb

## Usage
Currently, there is only one working example of three.rb in action: the `demo` directory that is inside the main directory.
It shows the Ruby version of the app from the ["Creating a scene"](http://threejs.org/docs/#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene) tutorial on the three.js docs.
To run it, simply run:

    $ rackup

in the `demo` directory.
